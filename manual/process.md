This section explains how to laser processing.  
First, open the project to be processed, and display the project edit screen.

## Connect to machine
If you are not connected to the machine, tap “Disconnected” at the top of the screen, then tap “Connect”.
Tap the serial number of the target EtcherLaser to connect to the machine.

## Setting of focal length

Open the machine operation menu and tap Position Check.
Drag the displayed laser head on the material and tap the "Move" button.

When the laser head moved over the material, use the height adjustment jig to adjust the focal length.
※If the laser head is tilted, it may cause misalignment.

When the height adjustment is complete, press “Back” on the screen to return to the project editing screen.

## Check position

Open the machine operation menu and tap the “Capture” button. Enter the capture surface height here.
※ Usually, enter the height of the material (the height of the machining surface from the machining bed).
※ When machining with the bottom open, enter the height of the machining surface as a negative value based on the machining bed.
※ If the entered height is not correct, it may cause misalignment.

## Position adjustment
When the capture is complete, the captured image of the work area is displayed on the canvas.
Check the positional relationship with the graphics item and adjust the position of the graphics item or material.

## Processing start

### Safety check items

- Is the height of the laser head correctly adjusted?
- Are there any obstacles in the processing area or near the processing machine?
- Is the bottom plate closed properly?
- When processing with the bottom open, is the base under the material safe from burning?  
(Laser light may reach the base depending on the thickness of the material)
- Is the processing range completely over the material?

-----------------

Open the machine operation menu and tap the “Start” button to display the estimated machining time.
Tap the “Start” button and the processing data will be sent to EtcherLaser.

After that, press and hold the start button (flashing green) of the processing machine to actually start processing.
