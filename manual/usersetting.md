## Machine
You can set the machining position offset here.
If there is a discrepancy between the captured image and the actual processing position, change this value (unit: mm).
- Offset X: Entering a positive value moves the machining position to the right.
- Offset Y: Entering a positive value moves the machining position downward.

Misalignment of the processing position can also occur for the following reasons. Please check here if so.
- If the height setting at capture is not appropriate
- If the laser head is tilted when adjusting the height of the laser head

## Wi-Fi Setting
